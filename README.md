# Phasor Beat Generators

Phasor-based versions of Topograph and uGraph by Valley Audio. These modules are ports of Mutable Instruments' excellent Grids module. These modules are separated from the HetrickCV repository due to the different licenses (Grids and Valley both use GPL, while HetrickCV is MIT).

## Modules

* Topograph - A port of the Mutable Instruments "Grids", the rhythm sequencer module that was missing from the VCV Audible Instruments plugin bundle. Covered by GPL-3.0 license.
* ÂµGraph - Same as Topograph except more compact. It does, however, default to the Olivier pattern modes rather than Henri.
